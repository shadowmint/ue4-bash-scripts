# UE4 bash scripts

For doing things on the command line, that should be simple!

## quickstart

Edit config.sh and setup the various paths

A typical setup should look like this:

    dev/bin/ <--- This repo
    dev/UnrealEngine <--- The UE4 engine source
    dev/projects/MyProject <--- Your project

You can then do, this for example:

    ./bin/build.sh MyProject
